I'm archiving this, in favor of a [pure Rust implementation](https://github.com/bdarcus/csln), from which the JSON schemas are generated.

# A demo of CSL-next codegen using quicktype

This is a demo repo of how code generation from the typescript models might work. It consists of:

1. a script to generate the rust `bibliography.rs`, `style.rs`, and `citation.rs` module files
2. a tiny `main.rs` that creates a `csln-rs` binary

Here's all that binary will do, but it demonstrates the deserialization and serialization of JSON or YAML `Style` or `InputBibliography` input files.

```console
‚ùØ time csln-rs style.csl.yaml bibliography.yaml
The name of the style is: "APA"
The number of entries in the bibliography is: 5

```

Because of a few [limitations](https://github.com/bdarcus/csln-rs/issues/2), I've decided to commit static source files based on the conversions, but modified in a few places, and output the generated files to a `generated` directory instead.

The `Style` model is fairly big, and even if I'd say it's simplified, it's still fairly complex.
